What we have in one element of the big array
- source --> title --> link to article

What we want to do
- Append in Img Link and Previews

Initial Process already made
- Get URL --> find news area --> scrap for links and titles

Need to now
- Connect to each link get the first img and the first paragraph --> another area to scrap

So how to access each link?
- If access on teh finished result it is going to be a pain --> access every time scrap for link

So how to do that? I mean, in multithreading way
- After running thread to scrap first hand on the surface
 --> access all links at once to get img and prev (1st paragraph)

Target area for each news
+ Economic Times
- img: .artImg img --> return img_agent[0]['src']
- prev: artText (using find_all --> no dots) --> return prev_agent[0].text.split("\n")[0]
